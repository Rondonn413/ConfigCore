## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use ConfigCore  

After downloading the file, follow these steps to use ConfigCore in your project:  

### 1. Prepare Your Project  

- Create a new folder for your plugin project.
- Place the downloaded ConfigCore `.jar` file into your project‚Äôs `libs` directory.

### 2. Setup Your Configuration  

Before using ConfigCore, you need to create configuration files. Here‚Äôs how:  

- Create a YAML file named `config.yml`.
- Add your settings according to the example below:

```yaml
settings:
  example_key: "This is an example value"
```

### 3. Initialize ConfigCore  

In your Java code, initialize ConfigCore like this:

```java
import com.joseplay.configcore.AbstractConfig;

public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    private AbstractConfig config;

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        config = new MyPluginConfig(this);
        config.load();
    }
}
```

### 4. Access Your Configuration  

You can now access your configuration values through the defined keys. Simply refer to your enum keys in the code:

```java
String value = config.getValue(MyEnumKey.EXAMPLE_KEY);
```

## üîç Features  

ConfigCore simplifies configuration management for Minecraft plugins with these key features:  

- **Unified Loading and Saving**: Automatically loads and saves YAML files.
